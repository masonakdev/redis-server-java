## Introduction

Welcome to the Build your own Redis challenge!

[Redis](https://redis.io/docs/latest/develop/get-started/data-store/) is an in-memory data structure store often used as a database, cache, message broker and streaming engine. In this challenge you'll build your own Redis server that is capable of serving basic commands, reading RDB files and more.

Along the way, you'll learn about TCP servers, the Redis Protocol and more.
