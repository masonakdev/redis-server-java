In this stage, you'll add support for reading a single key from an RDB file.

### Tests

The tester will create an RDB file with a single key and execute your program like this:

```
$ ./your_program.sh --dir <dir> --dbfilename <filename>
```

It'll then send a `KEYS "*"` command to your server.

```
$ redis-cli KEYS "*"
```

Your server must respond with a RESP array that contains the key from the RDB file:

```
*1\r\n$3\r\nfoo\r\n
```

### Notes

- The RDB file provided by `--dir` and `--dbfilename` might not exist. If the file doesn't exist, your program must treat the database as empty.
- RDB files use both little-endian and big-endian to store numbers. See the [MDN article on endianness](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Endianness) to learn more.
- To generate an RDB file, use the [`SAVE` command](https://redis.io/docs/latest/commands/save/).
